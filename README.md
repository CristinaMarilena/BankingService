# BankingService

##Overview

The project was implemented using mainly Java 8 as the backend language and Spring Framework for the integration of a dependency injection container that would initialize and manage the java objects( which are called beans in Spring).

## Requirements
For building and running the application you need:

JDK 1.8
Maven 3

## Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the main method in the com.blueharvest.demo.App class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the Spring Boot Maven plugin like so:

mvn spring-boot:run
